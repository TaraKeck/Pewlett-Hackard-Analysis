# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
The goal of this project was to evaluate the total number of employees that will be retiring at Pewlett Hackard. The data collected will allow us to review and understand how this will affect multiple departments/orgs and better prepare for the "“silver tsunami”   Lastly, there is also an opportunity for these employees to be part of a mentorship program as well which will be extremely beneficial for incoming applicants.  Results below will break down the data tables for eligible employees which will also be evaluated by title.

# RESULTS

- Total eligible employees for retirement:  41380

- Since there are employees that may have been with the company long term and been promoted or moved departments, there was a clean list of data created to ensure that there were no duplicates.  The data can be found here:  unique_titles.csv

- The mentorship program data shows that there is a total of 1,941 employees that qualify.   Here is a chart of breakdown per department:
