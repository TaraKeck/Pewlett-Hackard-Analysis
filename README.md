# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
The goal of this project was to evaluate the total number of employees that will be retiring at Pewlett Hackard. The data collected will allow us to review and understand how this will affect multiple departments/orgs and better prepare for the "“silver tsunami”   Lastly, there is also an opportunity for these employees to be part of a mentorship program as well which will be extremely beneficial for incoming applicants.  Results below will break down the data tables for eligible employees which will also be evaluated by title.

# RESULTS

- Total eligible employees for retirement:  41380 (who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955)

- Below is the Retiring Titles and count per each title:

- Since there are employees that may have been with the company long term and been promoted or moved departments, there was a clean list of data created to ensure that there were no duplicates.  The data can be found here:  unique_titles.csv

- The mentorship program data shows that there is a total of 1,941 employees that qualify and born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. Below is a chart of breakdown per department for mentorship:

# SUMMARY

The roles that would neeed to be filled is as follows:
- Senior Engineer - 29415 employees
- Engineer - 14221 employees
- Senior Staff - 8047 employees
- Technique Leaser - 4502 employees
- Assistant Engineer - 1761 employees

It would be up to Human Resources to do a deeper dive to see if there are any roles that are priority to ensure smooth transitions of roles.  
There are a total of 1,940 retirement ready employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.   There would be enough mentors to support this program but may not be sustainable if company has initiatives for growth.  There would be more meetings needed with team manangers and human resources to discuss future employment hiring goals.
