# CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
The goal of this project was to evaluate the total number of employees that will be retiring.  Since there are a lot of employees and the longevity of employees have been quite long, it was crucial to understand retirees and plan for human resources to start recruiting replacements.   The data collected will allow us to review and understand how this will affect multiple departments.   Lastly, there is also an opportunity for these employees to be part of a mentorship program as well which will be extremely beneficial for incoming applicants.
